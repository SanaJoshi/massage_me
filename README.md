# Rails Two-Sided Marketplace Application - 2nd term main Project



## Challenge


You are to design, build, deploy and present a Ruby on Rails application.

## Synopsis
The personal massage industry in Australia is currently worth $4 Billion with approximately 15,000 registered massage therapists.  As the service is very personal, many ladies don’t feel comfortable with the idea of going to a massage parlour and be allocated a male massage therapist to perform a full body massage on them. Many ladies are even more uncomfortable with the idea of a male massage therapist to visit their house.  Therefore, the concept of a LADIES ONLY massage where the providers and customers will all be ladies is potentially a very attractive concept.
